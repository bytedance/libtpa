Intel E810 Series
=================

To support the hardware flow bifurcation feature on the Intel E810 series, you
need to use out-of-tree Linux kernel drivers and firmwares.
You can find more information, including download links and recommended versions,
in the `DPDK Intel ICE driver guide <https://doc.dpdk.org/guides/nics/ice.html>`_.
Additionally, you need DPDK version **v22.11 or above**.

**Build and Install Linux Kernel Driver:**

After downloading the appropriate Linux kernel driver, you can build and install
it using the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    make install
    modinfo ice
    rmmod ice
    modprobe ice
